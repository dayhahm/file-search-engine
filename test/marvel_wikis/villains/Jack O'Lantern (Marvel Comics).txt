The second version of Jack O'Lantern was introduced as an enemy of [[Captain America]] and [[Spider-Man]].

This version of the character was subjected to much controversy, due to the fact that several years after his introduction he was rebranded "Mad Jack" and was heavily featured in the pages of ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' during the late 1990s. Mad Jack was ultimately revealed to be the duo of Daniel Berkhart (ex-Mysterio) and Maguire Beck (Mysterio's cousin). It was not until the one-shot ''New Avengers Most Wanted'' (a character compendium) that the second iteration was confirmed as a separate entity: '''Steven Mark Levins'''. However, the character's name would not be used in-story until ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 5 #10 (2007).

This incarnation was a professional criminal, and a partner of [[Blackwing]]. Alongside Blackwing, he searched Skullhouse and first battled Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #396-397</ref> With Blackwing, he was then admitted as a provisional member of the loosely knit band of the [[Red Skull]]'s operatives called the [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]].<ref>''Captain America'' #398. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Soon after that, Jack O'Lantern fought [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], and captured Diamondback.<ref>''Captain America'' #405-408</ref> Diamondback tried to escape, and Jack O'Lantern fought Diamondback in mid-air.<ref>''Captain America'' #409</ref> He was ultimately defeated in combat by the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and taken to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Captain America'' #410. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He also worked as an enforcer of the [[Golem (comics)|Golem]] and in this capacity, fought the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] when he interfered in Golem's machinations.

Jack O'Lantern later fought [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]] alongside [[Shockwave (comics)|Shockwave]] and [[Jackhammer (comics)|Jackhammer]] to attack the Thames Tunnel.<ref>''Union Jack'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following his defeat, Levins was recruited to serve as part of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] hero-hunting squad during the "Civil War" storyline. While pursuing Spider-Man through the Manhattan sewers alongside the [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]], Levins was killed when the [[Punisher]] shot Levins in the head, killing him instantly.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Penciller =  [[Steve McNiven]] | Inker = [[Dexter Vines]] | Story = War | Title = Civil War | Issue = 5 | Date = November 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> However, death would not be the end of Levins's story. His headless corpse was reanimated and possessed by a fragment of [[Lucifer]]'s soul. He and now exhibits the ability to detach, levitate and explode his head (now replaced with a real life pumpkin) among other powers. However, the Ghost Rider was able to [[exorcism|exorcise]] him by ripping his heart from his chest, setting it aflame and putting it back in his chest, causing it to explode inside.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 5 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Levins was among the dead characters seen in Erebus by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. He was later seen on [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]'s jury (alongside [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], [[Armless Tiger Man]], Artume, [[Heinrich Zemo]], [[Commander Kraken]], [[Iron Monger]], Kyknos, Nessus, [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], [[Scourge of the Underworld]], and [[Veranke]]) for [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]' trial.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline, Levins's Jack O'Lantern form was among the characters that were cloned by the [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]]. He got involved in a fight with the other cloned villains, causing the [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Prowler]]'s clone to break it up.<ref>''Prowler'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jack O'Lantern later battled [[Deadpool]] after stealing 20 million dollars from the ''Queen Kathleen'' gambling ship owned by [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]].<ref>''Despicable Deadpool'' #297. Marvel Comics.</ref>

There were two people who assumed the Mad Jack alias while wearing the Jack O'Lantern costume:

* Former Mysterio '''Daniel Berkhart''' was approached by [[Norman Osborn]] providing a version of the Jack O'Lantern costume, under the "Mad Jack" alias. Under Osborn's orders, Berkhart kidnapped [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] and exposed to mind-altering chemicals to be turned into a mind controlled pawn: the super-powered wolf alter-ego persona Man-Wolf. Jameson was then sent to attack [[J. Jonah Jameson]], to terrorize and cow into being subservient towards Osborn's scheme to buy the [[Daily Bugle]]. During this time, he also stalked Jameson's wife, Marla, implying that the two had a past relationship that Berkhart sought to rekindle.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #241-248. Marvel Comics.</ref>

* After Berkhart's working relationship with Osborn ended when the Green Goblin participated in a magical ritual that rendered him completely insane, Berkhart was then approached by '''Maguire Beck''', the female cousin of Quentin Beck (the original Mysterio). Maguire convinced Berkhart to re-assume the Mysterio identity following her cousin's suicide and the "Mad Jack" costumed identity was retired. But when the two sought to eliminate Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], J. Jonah Jameson and several other mutual enemies, the two revived the "Mad Jack" persona, with Maguire using holograms and lifelike robotic versions of Mad Jack and Berkhart himself to serve as proxies for herself while she laid in secret. In the end, Maguire was caught and exposed though due to her usage of Berkhart androids but Daredevil and Spider-Man were left unsure as to whether or not Berkhart was truly involved. However Berkhart did ultimately escape with a Mysterio costume, in the confusion at the end.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

In the miniseries ''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do'', Francis Klum purchased Mysterio's weapons and gimmick in order to be yet another new [[Mysterio]]. The seller, the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], said he had acquired the arsenal "from Jack-O-Lantern".<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Dark Reign" storyline, an unnamed man who claimed to be Steve Levins' brother has since been caught by the police after killing the 15 year old daughter of his neighbor and drinking his victim's blood as part of his plot to avenge Steve. This man was shown to be able to transform into a Jack O'Lantern-headed villain using the powers of a mystical demon. Detective Tom and Detective Steve interrogated the man. When asked about the pact with the demon, the man transformed into his Jack O'Lantern form where he is now surrounded by bats. When Detective Tom states that he is getting the [[electric chair]], Jack O'Lantern states that he's just biding his time until his "dark lord" arrives to set him free. He was later released by a lawyer sent by Norman Osborn who claimed that Jack O'Lantern is a material witness to a national security case. The lawyer drives away with Jack O'Lantern as Norman plans to gain his services.<ref>''Dark Reign: Made Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]", Steve Rogers knew about Jack O'Lantern, noting that Osborn didn't use Jack O'Lantern and suspects that Jack O'Lantern will continue his crusade to avenge his brother.<ref>''Heroic Age: Villains'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A new Jack O'Lantern appears working for the third [[Crime Master]].<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> As a child, the kid that would become Jack O'Lantern had disobeyed his parents and mistreated animals. While going as Jack O'Lantern for Halloween, he came across a house that Crime Master was in. The boy was taken under Crime Master's wing and trained him to be an assassin. It was with this training that the boy had killed his parents.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

One of his jobs brings him into conflict with the government operative Venom. During this conflict, Venom threw a live grenade into his mouthpiece and it dislocated his jaw. Even after the explosion, he was still able to run and retreat.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, Crime Master is able to use contacts to discover Venom's true identity [[Flash Thompson]], and has Jack O'Lantern kidnap [[Betty Brant]] (Flash's girlfriend) in exchange for Venom letting Crime Master get a shipment of Antarctic Vibranium. When Venom leaves to rescue Betty, he is distracted by Spider-Man's appearance, which drives the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote into an uncontrollable rage. Eventually Betty is rescued at the last second by Spider-Man, with Venom then trying to recapture Crime Master. However, Venom is attacked by Jack O'Lantern who proclaims Flash as his first real nemesis, and desiring revenge for the disfiguring grenade explosion, also mockingly calling out Venom's first name.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #3-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> While it hasn't been confirmed, this depiction claims to have killed every other person to go by the Jack O'Lantern name in an effort to "clean up the brand".<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jack O'Lantern is a member of the Crime Master's [[Savage Six]].<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jack O'Lantern in his human guise goes first and targets Betty only to end up fighting Venom. During the fight, Megatak assists Jack O'Lantern and punches Venom's phone before he can make a call to the Avengers for help.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jack O'Lantern targets Jessie Thompson and ends up fighting Venom. Venom grabs Jack O'Lantern's gun and fires on him before Jack O'Lantern spews acid on him, causing Venom to cool down in the fountain.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jack O'Lantern later goes on a killing spree which escalated on Father's Day. Venom tracked him to a sewer thanks to the hidden trail Jack O'Lantern had left behind for him. There, he discovered that Jack had dug up the corpse of Flash's father and blew up the room. In the fight that ensued, it looked like Jack O'Lantern was going to win until Venom took his father's gun from the holster and shot him. Venom chose not to kill Jack O'Lantern.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jack O'Lantern was incarcerated at the Raft.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> He managed to continue his operations using an employee of a storage facility as a replacement who Jack O'Lantern's robots brainwashed.<ref name="Venom #37">''Venom'' vol. 2 #37. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]" storyline, Jack O'Lantern appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against the Red Skull's [[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]] form.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> His moral compass was inverted with all of those in Genosha when a spell meant to affect only the Red Skull affected everyone on the island.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #3.

Marvel Comics.</ref> When a reinversion spell was cast, Jack O'Lantern was evil once again.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, Jack O'Lantern was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Jack O'Lantern appears as a member of the Army of Evil where they attack Manhattan in retaliation for what happened at Pleasant Hill.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jack O'Lantern is eventually hunted down for his many crimes by [[Eddie Brock]], and is beaten within an inch of his life. Brock lets him live, although it is implied Brock breaks Jack's spine and leaves him in a critical condition before being teleported away to a parallel universe.<ref>''Venomverse'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jack O'Lantern was hospitalized following this, and underwent plastic surgery to restore his face and intensive therapy. Jack O'Lantern was released to civilian life, but grew bored almost immediately and returned to supervillainy. Following [[Deadpool]] to [[Wakanda]], Jack O'Lantern battles both Deadpool and [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] until Deadpool shot him in the head, killing him.<ref>''Deadpool vs. Black Panther'' #2-3.

===Imposters===
There have been different unnamed imposters of Jack O'Lantern:

* As mentioned above, Crime-Master's Jack O'Lantern brainwashed a factory worker into posing as him. He was among the villains gathered by Lord Ogre to attack Venom.<ref name="Venom #37"/> Jack O'Lantern later attacked Flash's neighbor Andrea Benton which ended in her father's death as Flash protected Andrea.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 2 #38. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Andrea attacked Jack O'Lantern for what happened to her father, the mask came off and Venom saw that this wasn't Crime-Master's Jack O'Lantern. The factory worker explained that he worked at a storage facility and was hypnotized into being Jack O'Lantern by one of Jack O'Lantern's robots. After Venom prevented Andrea from killing him, the imposter Jack O'Lantern was taken into police custody and slipped into a coma moments later.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 2 #39. Marvel Comics.</ref>

* An unnamed petty criminal stumbled upon the Jack O'Lantern equipment and became Jack O'Lantern in order to become a supervillain and an arms dealer. He was supplying weapon to criminals from Norman Osborn's armory which attracked the attention of Venom and the police. The Venom symbiote went berserk and ripped out his left eye.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After escaping from Venom, the second Jack O'Lantern imposter was seen at the Bar With No Name where he told his tale to the patrons. The Bar With No Name was later attacked by Venom causing the patrons to flee.<ref>''Venom Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the "[[War of the Realms]]" storyline, the second Jack O'Lantern imposter found one of [[Malekith the Accursed]]'s War Witches having teleported into his apartment following a fight with a Dreamstone-enhanced Eddie Brock.

Jack O'Lantern accepts the offer from the War Witch as he reaches out to touch the Dreamstone.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Steven Levins modeled his Jack O'Lantern costume and equipment after those created by his predecessor Jason Macendale. Levins wore a complete body armor made of metal-mesh covered in multi-segmented Kevlar panels, incorporating a rigid, articulated shell which can resist a 7-pound bazooka anti-tank warhead. He wore a bulletproof helmet with an internal three hour, compressed air supply. The helmet is equipped with a telescopic infrared image-intensifier for seeing in the dark and 360 degree scanning device for seeing all around himself. The base of the helmet is equipped with a fine network of pinholes which maintain a low temperature, low density flame ("stage-fire") that rings the helmet at all times. The air supply cools the helmet's interior. The helmet is padded to protect his head from injury. Levins is armed with wrist-blasters which can deliver an electrical shock within a range of {{convert|35|ft|m}}. He also used various types of grenades, including anesthetic, lachrymatory (tear gas), hallucinogenic, and regurgitant gas grenades, smoke grenades, and concussion grenades. The grenades are shaped like spheres or pumpkins. He can fire small grenades from wrist devices. He can also release "ghost-grabbers" which are thick, semi-transparent films which adhere to a victim. Levins rides atop a one-man hovercraft with an electric motor powered by a high density lithium rechargeable battery.

Daniel Berkhart used the same weapons as the previous incarnations of Jack O'Lantern, along with chemical weapons that cause psychedelic and mind-bending hallucinations. His accomplice Maguire Beck was an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master hypnotist, and skilled in chemistry and robotics, including a lifelike robotic black cat. Beck has used her advanced knowledge of computer imaging and virtual reality to improve upon Mysterio's techniques, allowing for Beck to pretend to be Mad Jack via proxies while safely hidden in her secret lair.

The brother of Levins can transform into a demon with the head of a jack-o'-lantern using the powers of an unknown mystical demon.

The fifth incarntaion, along with the same general weapons the previous ones used, has a fleet of tiny flying cartoon-styled devil robots. Instead of a hovercraft, he rides a jet-powered "broomstick".

==Other versions==
===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] timeline, Maguire Beck is that [[Spider-Ham]] character to lure Spider-Man to the Heartland Entertainment building. Once there, Spider-Man met up with [[Anya Corazon|Araña]], and together they battled robots created by Jack O'Lantern.{{issue|date=February 2014}} Years later, Maguire lured [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] to the same location. After fighting several Jack O'Lanterns, Spider-Girl finished them off and discovered that Maguire was really a robot.{{issue|date=February 2014}}

===Earth-Chaos===
On the day before Halloween 13 years after the Chaos! event, Jack O'Lantern launched a scheme to bring about a hell on Earth and take over the world with the proper alignment of cosmos. Raising dead persons and animating dinosaurs, he looked to gather the remaining heroes of the world for the purpose of eliminating them. However, Brother Voodoo (Jericho Drumm) and the Supernaturals were able to overcome his machinations, sending Jack into another dimension. With Jack gone, his minions disappeared and the world was saved. Jack O'Lantern may still be holding the heroes captured from the first Chaos! event in his wand and plotting another takeover of the Earth.{{issue|date=April 2014}}

===[[JLA/Avengers]]===
Jack O'Lantern is among the enthralled villains defending [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold when the heroes assault it. [[Tasmanian Devil (comics)|Tasmanian Devil]] is shown pushing some rocks onto him.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4. DC Comics/Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Spider-Geddon ===
In the ''[[Spider-Geddon]]'' event on Earth-11580, a version of Jack O'Lantern is seen alongside the [[Green Goblin]], [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] and [[Demogoblin]] during the Goblin Night.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Television===
* An unidentified version of Jack O'Lantern appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors]]''. This version is the result of [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] magically placing a jack-o'-lantern on the head of a [[security guard]] (voiced by [[Drake Bell]]<ref>{{cite episode|title=Halloween Night at the Museum|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=75|airdate=October 10, 2016}}</ref>) to bring about the end of the world. In the episode "Halloween Night at the Museum" (which was a crossover with ''[[Jessie (2011 TV series)|Jessie]]''), Jack O'Lantern attacks Spider-Man, Jessie Prescott, and the Ross Kids in the space exhibit. While Spider-Man handles Jack O'Lantern, Jessie and the Ross Kids hide out during the battle. After Morgan le Fay is defeated, Jack O'Lantern regresses back to the security guard.

Spider-Man made a lot of Halloween puns fighting him.
