The character first appears in ''[[Machine Man]]'' #19 (Feb 1981), created by writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]]. 

The character was killed off in ''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' #1 in order to make room for [[Roderick Kingsley]] to assume the Hobgoblin mantle. Writer [[Roger Stern]] recounted being initially uncertain of how to resolve the situation of there being two Hobgoblins:

{{quote|When I was preparing to revisit the Hobgoblin, I went over the story that [[Howard Mackie|Howard [Mackie]]] and JR had done in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #68, which was still fairly recent at the time, and I said to the editors, "Wow, they did all this work to revamp the second Hobgoblinâ€”what do you want me to do? I can have Macendale beat my guy [Kingsley], anything you want, because you just went to all this trouble." I heard back and was told that I could open my story by having my guy ''kill'' Macendale. That left things pretty open![emphasis in original]<ref>{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|authorlink= Glenn Greenberg|date= August 2009|title= When Hobby Met Spidey|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|page= 21|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==
Jason Macendale was a [[mercenary]] who was recruited out of college and trained by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and various para-military organizations. Macendale proved to be a liability to the organization, due to his violent nature and amoral personality. This rejection turned Macendale to be a mercenary and ultimately a costumed terrorist, as he adopted the '''[[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]''' alter ego.<ref>''Machine Man'' #19</ref> Jack O'Lantern was a regular nemesis for Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #56</ref> He was later hired to retrieve the Hobgoblin's lost battle van and despite Spider-Man's untimely appearance, pulling off the mission successfully.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #254</ref>

When [[Flash Thompson]] insulted the Hobgoblin on national television which had incurred the Hobgoblin's wrath to frame Thompson so that criminal enemies might target Flash instead,<ref name="Unmasked">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = Breeding, Brett | story = Unmasked! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 276 |date = May 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Macendale subsequently broke Thompson out of jail, thinking he was doing the Hobgoblin a favor. Macendale discovered that the Hobgoblin had planned to operate "under the radar" while Thompson was in custody; this began a long-running feud when the two battled for the first time.<ref name="Clash">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = Breeding, Brett | story = When Warriors Clash--! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 281 |date = October 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> When the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] temporarily abdicated being the head of organized crime on the eastern seaboard and a resulting [[gang|gang war]] tore [[New York City]] apart, Macendale wished to increase his underworld status.<ref name="Foes">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Bob Layton|Layton, Bob]] | story = With Foes Like These... | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 276 |date = May 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="Stand">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Josef Rubinstein|Rubinstein, Josef]] | story = ...And Who Shall Stand Against Them...? | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 284 |date = January 1987| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="Arranger">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Owsley, James]] | cowriters = [[Tom DeFalco]] | penciller = [[Alan Kupperberg|Kupperberg, Alan]] | inker = Fern, Jim | story = The Arranger Must Die! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 285 |date = February 1987| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> He formed an alliance with the Hobgoblin. The Hobgoblin ultimately double-crossed Macendale when the two were fleeing a horde of police officers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #286</ref> Macendale vowed revenge, ultimately hiring the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] to have the Hobgoblin killed. After his co-conspirator's supposed death, all known copies of Goblin weapons and costumes were handed over to Macendale who took over the '''[[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]''' identity in order to steal notoriety within the supervillain community.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289</ref>

Macendale's scheme was foiled; he was exposed as the Hobgoblin and lost a battle against Spider-Man which was meant to prove his abilities.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #38</ref> Spider-Man considers Macendale "just a criminal", and thus (other than being sociopathic) the hero sees Macendale as a typical thug and not much of a threat as his predecessor and [[Norman Osborn]] (the original Green Goblin) in comparison.<ref name="Legacy of Evil">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Kurt Busiek|Busiek, Kurt]] | penciller = [[Mark Texeira|Texeira, Mark]] | inker = [[Mark Texeira|Texeira, Mark]]| title = Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil | issue = 1 |date = June, 1996| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Deciding he needed the original Hobgoblin's abilities if he was to match reputation, Macendale attempted to steal the Goblin secret formula for superhuman strength, resulting in a confrontation between himself and [[Harry Osborn]] (the second Green Goblin) where Macendale was overcame.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #312</ref>

Dejected and humiliated, Macendale offered to sell his [[soul]] to [[N'astirh]], a demon leading an [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|invasion of Manhattan]], in exchange for the power of a demon. N'astirh fused a demon to Macendale.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #147</ref> Enhanced by the demon's power but horrified to see his once handsome face transformed into a demonic one, Macendale blamed his suffering and hunted Spider-Man down for revenge. With his new demonic powers, Macendale defeated Spider-Man easily but [[Mary Jane Watson]] intervened before he could deliver the killing blow. This transformation finally made Macendale into the notorious supervillain he hoped to be at the cost of his humanity.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #48</ref>

Macendale put aside his personal enmity for Spider-Man, and used his new demonic powers to be a top contract killer.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #161</ref> As an independent mercenary and criminal, Macendale would clash with many other heroes, including [[Ghost Rider]],<ref>''Spider-Man'' #6-7</ref> [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]], [[Doctor Strange]],<ref>''Dr. Strange'' (vol. 3) #11</ref> and [[Darkhawk]]. He would also join the [[Sinister Six]]'s two reformed incarnations.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335-339</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #18-23</ref>

Eventually, Macendale's personality was overcome by the insane demon who shared his body and he began to consider himself an agent of God sent to Earth to kill sinners. This led him into conflict with the two Ghost Riders ([[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]) and Spider-Man; a blast from the "Hellfire Shotgun" during the battle destabilized the demon within Macendale, long enough for him to briefly regain his sanity.

During a fight between Macendale, Spider-Man, [[Moon Knight]] and Doctor Strange, the heroes realized that Macendale's insanity was partly caused by despair over losing his handsome face. To try to calm the monstrous man/demon, Doctor Strange agreed to cast an illusion spell upon Macendale that caused Macendale to see his true face in reflections of himself. This helped Macendale enough that he was ultimately able to expel the demon from within himself, with the demon referring to itself as the [[Demogoblin]]. As Hobgoblin, Macendale was stiff-armed by [[Doctor Octopus]] into joining the Sinister Six's second incarnation which twice tried to take over the world, failing due to counter measures by Spider-Man, the [[Hulk]], Ghost Rider, the [[Fantastic Four]] and many more heroes.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335-339</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #18-23</ref> In a rare event, Macendale teamed up with Spider-Man to defeat the duo of Demogoblin and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]].<ref>''Spider-Man'' #24, ''Spirits of Vengeance'' #5</ref>

The Hobgoblin was hired by the Foreigner to assassinate Moon Knight and Nick Katzenberg, only to be stopped by Moon Knight and Spider-Man. Spider-Man turned him over to the authorities.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #93-96, ''Spirits of Vengeance'' #6</ref>

Macendale obtained [[Kraven the Hunter]]'s strength formula, which enabled him to easily defeat his demonic doppelganger Demogoblin who then died saving a young child in battle.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #47-49</ref>

Macendale was defeated once more by Spider-Man along with [[Coldheart (comics)|Coldheart]], during an attempt to kidnap Macendale's long-lost son. However, Macendale's reunion would be an unhappy one as Macendale attempted (unsuccessfully) to use his son as a hostage to avoid going back to jail. He would remain in jail for some time before being freed by [[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]], sending him into combat against the second [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Man]]. In exchange for doing Gaunt's bidding, the scientist turned Macendale into a cyborg, complete with removal of one of Macendale's eyes with a new high-tech cybernetic eye. He failed and was once again arrested.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #411</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #68-69</ref>

Macendale went on trial for his many crimes. Found guilty on several counts (including convictions for the original Hobgoblin's acts), Macendale disgustingly responded by revealing that [[Ned Leeds]] was the Hobgoblin. His continued testimony leads Spider-Man recounting encounters with the original Hobgoblin, and realized that Ned cannot possibly be the villain due to the lacked of powers (and was killed when Macendale paid the Foreigner).<ref name="Wolverine">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Owsley, James]] | penciller = [[M.

A bank robbing [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] (initially misidentified as Macendale) is captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]''; this individual was using several false aliases including Jason Macendale, Maguire Beck ([[Mysterio]]'s cousin), and Mad Jack (Daniel Berkhart). The true identify of this Jack O'Lantern was never revealed but it was not any of the aliases he was using.<ref>{{Cite comic

==Powers and abilities==
Jason Macendale originally possessed no superhuman powers, but used similar paraphernalia to the Hobgoblin and the Green Goblin; both his Jack O'Lantern and Hobgoblin personas used a rocket-powered glider, pumpkin bombs, and gauntlet blasters. During the time in which a demon was grafted to him, he had superhuman strength, speed, and agility, as well as hellfire powers enabling him to create weapons and gliders at will. It is implied that his demonic abilities allowed him to create organic fibers strong enough to bind a normal person.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #6</ref> After acquiring Kraven the Hunter's formula, Macendale had enhanced his strength, speed, stamina, durability, reflexes, and agility to superhuman levels, thanks to anomalies in his blood left over when he and Demogoblin were one, but this formula's effects seemed to have later wore off. His later cybernetically enhanced body thanks to [[Mendel Stromm]] further increased his strength, speed, reflexes, durability, and stamina. Macendale had extensive military training in hand-to-hand combat, martial arts, espionage, and knowledge of conventional weaponry. He often used conventional military weapons. When he adopted the Hobgoblin persona, he was able to make improvements to the Goblin gilder's maneuverability by utilizing skills he gained from his master's degrees in both mechanical engineering and physics. Macendale was also a [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]] and a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]], which led to his dishonorable discharge from the military.
